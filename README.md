# Paddy text editor

Paddy is a very simple text editor, which aims for minimalistic user interface combined with good usability. Right now, it provides not much more than very simple notepad like *text editing, saving and opening files.*

## Use

Paddy is meant to be used as a _distraction free writing tool_. It is certainly not a programming or coding tool, as Syntax highlighting and build tasks are never going to be supported. 

## Markdown

The syntax you see in this document is known as *Markdown*, but you probably knew that. In future versions of Paddy, you will be able to export your markdown documents into neatly formatted __HTML__ files or even __PDFs__.
